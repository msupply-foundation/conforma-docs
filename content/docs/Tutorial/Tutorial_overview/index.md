### Creating a user account and logging in

1.  First you'll need to open your web browser. We would recommend Chrome for this.

2.  Enter the web address (URL) of your Conforma server. In our case we're using https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50000/ - our test web site. 
    
    This will take you to the log-in page.

3.  Click the **Create new account** button.

4.  Fill out the basic user information form. 

     Once you have completed the form click the **Review & Summary** button 

![Basic User Information Form](/docs/about/demo/2.png)

5.  Complete a final review of the form. Once you are happy, click the **Submit application** button.

6.  Time to check your email! A verification email will be sent to the email address you provided in the form. Verify the account by selecting the link.

7.  Now your account is verified! Click the log in button to navigate back to the log in screen.

8.  Great, now go ahead and log in! If there was a problem, you'll see an error message, like this:

<div class="tip">
If you are having trouble logging (note that username and password are case-sensitive), click the Forgot my password button and follow the instructions. 
</div>


### Navigating around

Great, now your logged in to the Conforma system. 

This main view is called the **Dashboard**.

The image and table below outline the basics of navigating within the system.

| 5 |  Applications overview | This panel displays a summary of your available applications and a summary of your submitted applications |

### Moving through the system

Because the system is flexible and can be set up by a Regulatory Authority to manage their particular applications and processes, in this demonstration system we have set up some example workflows for you to interact with. 

For this tutorial, the system has been preconfigured to require a user to be a member of a registered company before submitting a product registration application. 

The following diagram shows how users are expected to move through the system:
