## Incoroporating recognised standards

We have designed Conforma to meet international standards for regulatory systems from how we designed the system - for example ensuring applications can be submitted in line with Common Technical Document format, to the data we use in the system - standardised data tables for terms and definitions.

Here are some key examples.

#### Good Review Practices

Features to encourage Good Review Practices are built into the system.

#### Ingredient names

Using the International Nonproprietary Names (INN) for the identification of pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients.

#### ATC Classification

Capturing the products using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.

#### Access to data tables

Data tables for dose forms, routes and methods of administration, containers, closures, administration devices and units of presentation to help improve data quality and sharing. 

You can also use your own data and standards if needed.
