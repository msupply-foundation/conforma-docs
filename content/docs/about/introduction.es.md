## What is Conforma?

![header](/docs/about/demo/cc.png)

Conforma is an open-source web based software that provides a set of tools to help streamline the work processes of medicines regulatory authorities.

We know that different organisations processes are unique, and will change over time. That is why we built Conforma to flexible and easily configured without development to adapt an organisations needs. 

**We have built Conforma around:**

1. Being an open source accessible software that can support countries worldwide in improving their regulatory systems. We want to remove cost barriers for top notch products that improve healthcare.

2. Knowing there is no one size fits all for regulatory processes. We have made Conforma flexible and easily configurable so it doesn't need costly development wnen being adapated for a country or organisation.

3. Allowing for an integrated system that stores all your information in one place for co-ordinated work and reporting. We know that users don't need to see everything all at once, so Conforma allows for highly granular permissions.

4. To be a sustainable and high standard information management system by incorporating internationally standardised terminology, transparent review and application practices and allowing for interoperability and data sharing.

5. Making the users lives easier! By making processes more efficient with  user friendly workflows and a modern easy to use system design.

### What does Conforma do?

Conforma has been designed to manage and improve work processes for medicinal regulatory authorities. 

But Conforma is not limitied to those types of workflows, it is highly flexible and can also assist in managing the work processes of endless organisation types, such as loan applications for banks or internal HR processes. 

**In short, Conforma provides a platform to:**

- Create and manage digital application forms
- Manage complex application lifecycle workflows
- Monitor and report on applications and outcomes
- Create databases of information
- Provide communication channels between internal and external users
- Store notes and files related to an application or workflow
- Track the history of applications and the workflow process
- Assign highly granular roles and permissions to users

Putting that all together, Conforma's functionality and flexibility means that it can be used in a wide range of situations in managing workflows and processes.

**Here are some examples of key worfklows that Conforma has been designed to manage:**

## A little bit about us

Conforma has been developed by the team at [The mSupply Foundation](https://msupply.foundation/about) - a friendly bunch who aim to create useful, open-source software in order to improve healthcare solutions in low to middle-income countries. 

Creating Conforma has been a labour of love — thousands of hours of work. We hope you find it a joy to use, and that it results in your regulatory organisation being able to perform its role accurately, quickly and to a high standard.

Conforma's development was kindly sponsored by the [Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade](https://www.dfat.gov.au/).
