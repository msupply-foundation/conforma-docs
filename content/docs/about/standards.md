## How do I access it?

Conforma is a web-based software, which can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop systems, as well as on tablets.

Conforma is accessed through a web browser (we recommend ensuring your browser is the most up-to-date version).

## Where to from here?

If you would like to learn more about Conforma or are interested in using the system, please reach out to our team at [the mSupply Foundation](https://msupply.foundation/contact):

support@conforma.nz

A demo version of Conforma is available for you or your team to test, complete with guidance for different types of users. Please see the [Demo](https://docs.conforma.nz/docs/Demo/accessingdemo/) section.

## Accessing the source code

Half of the Conforma code is available from the [Conforma server repository](https://github.com/openmsupply/conforma-server) and the other half from the [Conforma front-end repository](https://github.com/openmsupply/conforma-web-app).

Alternatively, we can work with you to help set up Conforma. Send us an email at support@conforma.nz.
