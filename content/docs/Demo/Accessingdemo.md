We have developed a demo version of Conforma to help you get a feel for how it works. 

Just like any version of Conforma, the demo is accessed by all users through a web browser.

 <div class="tip">
Conforma can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop systems, as well as on tablets. We recommend that you ensure your browser version is up to date.
 </div>

The link to the demo is here: [https://demo.conforma.nz/login](https://demo.conforma.nz/login).

## Setting up as a new user in the demo
You can set up your own user account and explore Conforma as an external user (e.g. a supplier), and as an internal user (e.g. as a regulator staff member). 

To set up an account, select <b>Request online demo</b>, and complete the basic user information. This account will remain valid for 24 hours.

Once you have registered, you will receive an email to verify your email address. Once you have verified your email by clicking the link, you will receive a second email that contains a link to your personalised demo version of Conforma. The second email will explain how to log in as an external user or an internal user with your credentials.


 <div class="tip">
Please note that your personalised demo is reset after 24 hours, after which, you will not have ongoing access to your account or applications that you have created.

## Guidance on how to navigate the demo
See the [Guidance](https://docs.conforma.nz/docs/TutorialExternal/creatingextuser/) sections for step-by-step walk-throughs on different activities and processes that you can familiarise yourself with in the Conforma Demo.

If you have any questions at all on the demo or on a specific process, please reach out to us at support@conforma.nz. 

## Accessing Conforma Data Visualisation 
We have also created a demo Conforma dashboard to show how Grafana can be used as a visualisation reporting tool to produce customisable integrated reports based on Conforma workflows and records. 

The link to the demo visualisation reporting tool is here: [https://demo1-dashboard.conforma.nz/](https://demo1-dashboard.conforma.nz/)
