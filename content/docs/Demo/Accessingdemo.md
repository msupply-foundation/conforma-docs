We have developed a demo version of Conforma to help you get a feel for how it works. 

Just like any version of Conforma, the demo is accessed by all users through a web browser.

 <div class="tip">
Conforma can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop systems, as well as on tablets. We recommend that you ensure your browser version is up to date.

The link to the demo is here: [https://demo.conforma.nz/login](https://demo.conforma.nz/login).

## Setting up as a new user in the demo
You can set up your own user account and explore Conforma as an external user (e.g. a supplier), and as an internal user (e.g. as a regulator staff member) to explore the various workflows and functions of Conforma. 

To set up an account, select <b>Request online demo</b>, and complete the basic user information. This account will remain valid for 72 hours.

Once you have registered, you will receive an email to verify your email address. Once you have verified your email by clicking the link, you will receive a second email that contains a link to your personalised demo version of Conforma. The second email will explain how to log in as different external users or internal users with your credentials.


 <div class="tip">
Please note that your personalised demo is reset after 72 hours, after which, you will not have ongoing access to your account. You can re-register again if you wish to keep exploring, however you wonâ€™t have access to applications that you have created.
