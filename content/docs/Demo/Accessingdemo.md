## Accessing the Demo
We have developed a demo version of Conforma to help you get a feel for how it works. 

Just like any version of Conforma, the demo is accessed by all users through a web browser.

 <div class="tip">
Conforma can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop systems, as well as on tablets. We recommend that you ensure your browser version is up to date.
 </div>

The link to the demo is here: [https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50000/login](https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50000/login).

## Setting up as a new user in the demo
You can set up your own user account as an external user (as a supplier), or you can log in with an existing user account below:

<b>External user:</b>

Username: External_User

Password: demo


<b>Internal user:</b>

Username: Internal_User

Password: demo

 <div class="tip">
Please note that the demo is reset regularly so you will not have ongoing access to an account or applications that you have created.
 </div>

## Guidance on how to navigate the demo
See the [Tutorials](https://docs.conforma.nz/docs/TutorialExternal/creatingextuser/) sections for step by step walk-throughs on different activities and processes that you can familiarise yourself with in the Conforma Demo.

If you have any questions at all on the demo or on a specific process, please reach out to us at support@conforma.nz. 

## Accessing Conforma Data Visualisation 
We have also created a demo version to show how Grafana can be used as a visualisation reporting tool to produce customisable integrated reports based on Conforma workflows and records. 

The link to the demo visualisation reporting tool is here: [https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50001](https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50001)
