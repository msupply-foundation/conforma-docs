## Workflows

Custom workflows can be set up to suit your organisation’s requirements, and all processes can be carried out with integrity and efficiency.

These custom workflows can be configured to incorporate sequential and parallel steps, review processes, and provide options for communication between different users.

The diagram below outlines the overall application of Conforma, which incorporates a number of different workflows.

Workflows can be set up to enable external users to share information with internal users or simply for documentation purposes. Single or multi-step review processes can be created to suit a company’s procedures, including different permissions for each step of the review.
