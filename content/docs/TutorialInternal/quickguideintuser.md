## Application review permissions
The types of applications/workflows an internal user can interact with are limited by their permissions.

For example, an internal user that is an administrative advisor for a Regulatory Authority may be set up to be able to see and review company registrations, but not medicine registration applications, whereas medicines evaluators for the Regulatory Authority may be set up to review medicine registration applications.
