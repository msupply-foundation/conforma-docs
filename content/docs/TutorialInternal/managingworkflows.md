Regulatory Authority managers and staff can manage application workflows easily as internal users within Conforma. The database of applications and their current status is easily searchable and can be filtered by just about any variable, allowing internal users to identify and prioritise pending work.

1. To view pending applications, select the workflow/application of choice either through the dashboard or from the Application List drop down.

2. By selecting the filter option, you can select whatever variable you wish to filter the database of applications by.

3. In the example below, the reviewer action option of ‘Self Assign’ has been selected, identifying all the applications ready to be assigned.
