## Accessing Conforma
1. Open your internet browser to access Conforma, which is a web-based application. We recommend ensuring your browser is up to date.  

2. Navigate to the system URL (this will be different for every set-up).

<div class="tip">
On a typical setup, a login page will appear as shown below. An admin user at your agency will need to create an account for you to access Conforma.
</div>

Setting up an account is different for the demo version of Conforma, which is outlined in the [Accessing the Demo](https://docs.conforma.nz/docs/Demo/accessingdemo/) section.
