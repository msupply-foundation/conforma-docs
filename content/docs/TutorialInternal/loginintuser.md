## Accessing Conforma
1. Open your internet browser to access Conforma, which is a web-based application. We recommend ensuring your browser is up to date.  

2. Navigate to the system URL (this will be different for every set-up).

<div class="tip">
On a typical setup, a login page will appear as shown below. An admin user at your agency will need to create an account for you to access Conforma.

## Creating an account for the Conforma demo

Setting up an account is slightly different for the demo version of Conforma - see: [Accessing the Conforma Demo](https://docs.conforma.nz/docs/Demo/accessingdemo/).

4. Review your answers on the form, then click the <b>Submit</b> button.

5. Once you have registered, a verification email will be sent to the email address you provided in the form. Verify your account by clicking the provided link in the email you received.

<div class="tip">
Please note that your personalised demo is reset after 24 hours, after which, you will not have ongoing access to your account or applications that you have been working on.

7. Enter your username and password. To log in as an internal user, you will need to use the following details:

<b>Username:</b> Internal_User

<b>Password:</b> what you entered when registering for the demo
