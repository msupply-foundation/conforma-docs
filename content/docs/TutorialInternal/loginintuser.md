## Accessing Conforma
1. Open your internet browser to access Conforma, which is a web-based application. We recommend ensuring your browser is up to date.  

2. Navigate to the system URL (this will be different for every set-up). The demo version of Conforma is available here: https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50000/login. 
The login page will appear as shown below:

An admin user at your agency will need to create an account for you to access Conforma as an internal user.

Alternatively, if you are using the Conforma demo, you can log straight in using with an existing user account below:

<b>Internal user:</b>

Username: Internal_User

Password: demo
