## Do you offer support?

We can provide support in the set-up, hosting, maintenance, on-going support and training. 

## Is my data secure?

Whether deployed locally or remotely, Conforma is secure. 

Conforma uses a postgreSQL database to store data. The database is only accessible via a secure HTTPS connection through Conforma. Users require password credentials to access Conforma and passwords are encrypted via bcrypt (recommended encryption mechanism by OWASP). 

Additionally, the database uses row level policies to restrict user access to only data to which they are specifically permitted to access.

Anytime! Please send us an email at support@conforma.nz and we will be in touch.
