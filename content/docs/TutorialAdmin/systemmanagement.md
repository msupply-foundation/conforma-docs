## Template File Management

Documents can be uploaded into Conforma to be used in any template/workflow. This can include documents such as Carbone templates, which are used to generate a .pdf with information from a completed form.

In order to manage the template files: 
1. Select <b>Template File Management</b> from the Manage dropdown menu

2. This opens the File Management Form. In this window, select the template that you would like to use your file in, or leave this blank if it is not associated with a template

3. You will then be prompted to select whether to add a new file or update an existing file
