## Accessing Conforma

1. Open your internet browser to access Conforma, which is a web-based application. We recommend ensuring your browser is up to date. 

2. Navigate to the system URL (this will be different for every set-up).

On a typical setup, a login page will appear as shown below. You will need to create an account to access Conforma.

Setting up an account is slightly different for the demo version of Conforma, which is outlined in the [Accessing the Demo](https://docs.conforma.nz/docs/Demo/accessingdemo/) section.

## Creating an account

1. From the login page, click the <b>Create new account</b> button.

<div class="tip">
Remember - the forms shown here and in the demo are just example forms. They can be changed to suit your needs!

2. Fill out the user registration form.
