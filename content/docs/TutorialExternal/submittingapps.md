There are endless application types which can be developed in Conforma. A number of custom workflows have been developed for different Conforma users. 

In this guide, we will go through the steps of a medicine application. This will cover the basics of submitting applications and should transfer to other application types. 

If you have any questions or issues relating to an application, please reach out to support@conforma.nz

The application form saves automatically as you go. So you can just leave and continue your application at any time.

## Submitting a new application
As noted, this example is for submitting a medicinal product registration application in the Conforma Demo, but the process is similar for all application types.

1. Ensure you are logged into your account and have selected your registered company.

2. Select <b>Start a new Medicinal Product Registration Application</b>.

<div class="tip">
If you are logged into the Conforma demo, you can continue one of the existing draft applications where the information has been pre-filled.
</div>

3. Before you start a new application, the system will provide you with an overview page to provide guidance to what information and documents are required.

4. When ready to begin the application click <b>Get Started</b>.
