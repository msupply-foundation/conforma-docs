Before you can submit any applications, you will need to register your company or become a member of a registered company.

2. Before you start a new application, the system will provide you with an overview page to give guidance to applicants and indicate what information and documents are required. Once you have reviewed this information and are ready to begin the application click <b>Get Started</b>.

3. Fill in the application form with the required information, using the <b>Next</b> button to move through the pages. 

Within the system there are lots of different field types used to capture information. The following are examples of the some common field types:

 - <b>Drop down lists</b> - for selecting the applicable option from the list.

 ## Approval of your company

Your application to register a company has been submitted, and will need to be approved by an internal user for the regulatory authority. 

In the dashboard, you will now see that within the Company Registrations module, you now have one submitted application.

 If you are using the Conforma demo, company registration applications are automatically approved and you will be able to submit applications as a member of the registered company. You will need to log out and log back in for this to take effect.
