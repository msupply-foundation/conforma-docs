Conforma is a web-based application that allows all users to access the system through a browser as long as they have internet.

## User types

Lets go over a couple of the common user types and how they can interact with the system. 


![users](/docs/about/demo/users.png)

#### External user

An external user is a user that is outside of your organisation, one that interacts with your organisation through sending applications or providing notifications of important details. 

So what kinds of things can external users do in the system?: 

- Submit applications such as 'Product registrations' to a regulatory agency for review.
- Respond to queries and requests for information from the regulatory agency. 
- Receive system generated correspondence related to submitted applications. 
- Track and manage applications within the systems. Transparency is key in reducing the number of enquiries a regulatory agency revieves from applicants.  
- View and manage any outcomes of their applications, such as 'Registered Products' or 'Licences'.

### Internal user

An internal user is a staff member to the Organisation using Conforma to manage their processes, such as a regulatory authority.

So what kinds of things can internal users do in the system?: 

- Review and determine outcomes for submitted applications. 
- Manage complex work processes 'Workflows' in the system. We know that complex workflows such as managing drug registration require multiple steps and people involved. 
- Generate official correspondence related to an application. This includes approval certificates or requesting an applicant amend their application. 
- Store notes and files related to an application process - Think meeting minutes, lab results or evaluation reports. 
- Track and manage the lifecycle of applications and their products in the system, such as 'Renewal applications of licences'. 
- Manage workloads, track applications and manage and view databases of application by-products. 
- View data and reports from a centralised location!

### Admin user

Last but not least we have admin users. These users are able to peform higher level administrative and configuration functions.

So what kinds of things can admin users do in the system?: 

- Manage users and their permissions.
- Edit existing workflows or forms or even create new ones. 
- Turn on or off different modules or worfklow as needed.
- Edit the wording of emails or update generated documents. 
- Update and manage local data lists and look-up tables
- And much much more! 

One great thing about the Conforma system is that it can configured in the system interface in the easy to use template builder tool. This means that non-developer users can be trained on how to manage and configure their system, giving countries and organisations governance over their own systems.
