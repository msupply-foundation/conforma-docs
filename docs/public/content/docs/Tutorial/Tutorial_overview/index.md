### Creating a user account and logging in

1.  First you'll need to open your web browser. We would recommend Chrome for this.

2.  Enter the web address (URL) of your Conforma server. In our case we're using https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50000/ - our test web site. 
    
    This will take you to the log-in page.
