## Getting started

Alright, let's get started and create a user account. 

### Creating a user account and logging in

1.	First you'll need to open your web browser. We would recommend Chrome for this.
2.	Enter the web address (URL) of your Conforma server. In our case we're using https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50000/ - our test web site. This will take you to the log-in page.

<div class = "autowidth">
    <a href="docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/1.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/1.png" alt="" >
    </a>
</div>

3. 	Click the **Create new account** button.
4.	Fill out the basic user information form. 

<div class = "autowidth">
    <a href="docs/public/content/docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/2.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="docs/public/content/docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/2.png" alt="" >
    </a>
</div>

5. 	Complete a final review of the form. Once you are happy, click the **Submit application** button.
6. 	Time to check your email! A verification email will be sent to the email address you provided in the form. Verify the account by selecting the link.
7.	Now your account is verified! Click the log in button to navigate back to the log in screen.

<div class = "autowidth">
    <a href="docs/public/content/docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/3.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="docs/public/content/docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/3.png" alt="" >
    </a>
</div>

8.	Great, now go ahead and log in! If there was a problem, you'll see an error message, like this:

<div class = "autowidth">
    <a href="docs/public/content/docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/4.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="docs/public/content/docs/Tutorial/Starting_as_an_applicant_user/4.png" alt="" >
    </a>
</div>

Try re-typing the username and password (note that both are case-sensitive). If you are still having no luck, click the **Forgot my password button** and follow the instructions.
