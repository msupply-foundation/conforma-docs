## Getting started

This section contains a walkthrough of a demonstration configuration to showcase how Conforma can be used to manage workflows for a Regulatory Authority. 

You can access the demonstration system here:

Have fun exploring! 

### Using the system as an applicant user

The recommended way to get familiar with this the system is by starting as an applicant user. Applicant users are in the Conforma systems are users who submit applications via the platform to a regulatory agency. 

So what kinds of things can applicant users do in the system?: 

- Submit applications such as 'Pharmacy Registrations' or 'Product registrations' to a regulatory agency for review.
- Respond to queries and requests for information from the regulatory agency. 
- Track and manage applications within the systems. Transparency is key in reducing the number of enquiries a regulatory agency revieves from applicants.  
- Receive system generated correspondence related to submitted applications. 
- Allow users to have an overview the outcomes of their applications, such as 'Registered medicinal products' or 'Licences'


### Using the system as a regulatory authority user 

The follow up tutorial is how to use the system as a staff member of the regulatory authority. We call these users 'Internal users'. 

So what kinds of things can internal users do in the system?: 

- Review and determine outcomes for submitted applications. 
- Manage complex work processes 'Workflows' in the system. We know that complex workflows such as managing drug registration require multiple steps and people involved. 
- Generate official correspondence related to an application. This includes approval certificates or requesting an applicant amend their application. 
- Store notes and files related to an application process - Think meeting minutes, lab results or evaluation reports. 
- Track and manage the lifecycle of applications and their products in the system, such as 'Renewal applications of licences'. 
- Manage workloads, track applications and manage and view databases of application by-products. 
- And much more!
