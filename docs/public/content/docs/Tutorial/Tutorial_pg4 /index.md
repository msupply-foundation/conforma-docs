### Registering your company in the system

Now you have created a user account, it is time to become a member of a registered company. 

There are two ways users can be associated with a registered company:

 - By registering a new company in the system

- Joining an existing company (Companies can have more than one staff member!)

For this tutorial we are going to register a new company. 

----------------

1. Select the **Start a new Company Registration** button.

2. Before you start a new application, the system will provide you with a on overview page to give guidance to applicants and indicate what information and documents are required. 

    Once you have reviewed this information and are ready to begin the application click **Get Started**.

3. Go through and fill out the application form.

    Within the system there are lots of different field types used to capture information. The following are examples of the some common field types:

     **Drop down lists**

     Select the applicable option for the list

     ![Dropdown lists](/docs/about/demo/11.png)

     **Free text fields**

     Type the required text into the field

    **Look-up lists**

    As you type into the field, the list of options will filter down. You can select the correct option from the filtered list.

    **Upload boxes**

4.  Use the **Next button** to move through the different application pages. 

5. Once you have completed the form, select the **Review and Summary button.** 

6. You will then be provided a summary of your completed application for final review.  Once you are happy, click the **Submit application button**.

Great! Now your application to register a company has been submitted!

Whenever you submit applications in Conforma the system will provide you with an overview of the application process. We can see for this application there is only 1 stage **Appoval** for the application to progress through. 

However, for more complex application types such as product registration applications, an application will go through multiple stages before a decision is made!

![Application submitted overview](/docs/about/demo/19.png)

Let's head back to the dashboard now, using either the **Back to the dashboard** or the **Dashboard** navigation button.

Back in your dashboard you can now see that within the Company Registration module you know have 1 submitted application.

Now that our application has been submitted, we are going to learn how to review that application as a member of the Regulatory Authority. 

<div class="tip">
When working through this tutorial we recommend using an incognito mode or another browser when logging in as another account.

First things first let's log out of our applicant account from the user account menu in the top right.
