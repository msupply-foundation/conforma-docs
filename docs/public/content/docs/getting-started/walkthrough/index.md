## Overview

This section contains a walkthrough to showcase how Conforma can be used to manage workflows for a Drug Regulatory Authority. 

### Basic workflows

In this example system the Drug Regulatory Authority has several simple workflows that they manage using Conforma: 

- A way for internal users to maintain a database of registered pharmacies.
- A way for pharmacists to apply to register themselves as a member of one of the registered pharmacies. 
- A way for medical personnel to record and submit AEFIs or ADRs for review by one or more supervising medical personnel.

### Advanced workflows

The Drug Regulatory Authority also uses Conforma for more complex workflows, such as managing the lifecycle of bringing a new product to market subject to stringent quality and safety controls.
