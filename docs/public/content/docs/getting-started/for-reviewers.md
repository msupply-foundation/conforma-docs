## Overview

This section contains information for the people who review the applications that are submitted by applicants. 


## Basic concepts

### Application content

Application forms can be designed to match your exact requirements. 

The forms are highly customisable so that applicants provide you with the exact information that you require. 

### Application lifecycles

Each application flows along a specific pathway, from start to finish. 

You can use Conforma to design these pathways and to specify what action should happen when, and who should be involved. 

Actions can be automated - such as sending out an automated email response to the applicant or generating a document.
