## What is Conforma?

Conforma is an open source platform that provides a set of tools to help you to streamline your information workflows. 

The platform has been designed to allow seamless collaboration between internal and external users of the workflows. 

The primary use case of Conforma is to allow internal users to request information from external users via an interactive application form. 

This captured information may then be reviewed by the internal users. 

Further actions may then be triggered depending on the information provided and the requirements of the internal team. 

These actions may include generating certificates, sending email responses, unlocking new workflows to the user and more. 

Conforma also acts as a storage repository to capture files from internal and external users and to allow notes to be made for each workflow. 


## What can it do?

Conforma provides a platform to:

- Create application forms
- Manage complex application lifecycle workflows
- Assign roles and permissions to users
- Monitor the status of groups of applications
- Catalogue outcomes of applications
- Provide communication channels between internal and external users
- Store notes and files related to an application or workflow
- Track the history of workflow events
- Manage workloads of workflow participants

Some examples of regulatory frameworks where Conforma is currently being used: 

- New Drug Registrations
- Pharmaceutical Company Licensing
- Medicine Import / Export Permits

Conforma's flexibility means that it can be used in a wide range of situations. For clarity, this guide focuses on its intended use in healthcare regulatory environments. Suggestions for use of Conforma in other situations can be found in the [Uses of Conforma](//introduction/uses-for-conforma/) chapter.


## The team behind Conforma

Conforma has been developed by the team at [The mSupply Foundation](https://msupply.foundation/about) - a friendly bunch who aim to create useful, open-source software in order to improve healthcare solutions in low to middle-income countries. 

Creating Conforma has been a labour of love â€” thousands of hours of work. We hope you find it a joy to use, and that it results in your regulatory organisation being able to perform its role accurately, quickly and to a high standard.

Conforma's development was kindly sponsored by the [Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade](https://www.dfat.gov.au/).
