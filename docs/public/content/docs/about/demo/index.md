## Getting started


This section contains a walkthrough of a demonstration configuration to showcase how Conforma can be used to manage workflows for a Regulatory Authority. 

You can access the demonstration system here:

Have fun exploring! 

### Using the system as an applicant user

In this example system the Regulatory Authority has several simple workflows that they manage using Conforma: 

- A way for internal users to maintain a database of registered pharmacies.
- A way for pharmacists to apply to register themselves as a member of one of the registered pharmacies. 
- A way for medical personnel to record and submit AEFIs or ADRs for review by one or more supervising medical personnel.

### Using the system as a regulatory authority user 

The Regulatory Authority also uses Conforma for more complex workflows, such as managing the lifecycle of bringing a new drug product to market subject to stringent quality and safety controls.
